This repository contains my solution for the iFood Backend Advanced Test.
<br/>

Proposed problem:
<br/>
"Create a micro-service capable to receive RESTful requests receiving as parameter either city name or lat long coordinates and returns a playlist (only track names is fine) suggestion according to the current temperature."
<br/>

For the temperature data I used [OpenWeatherMaps API](https://openweathermap.org/) and [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/) for the song tracks.
<br/>

To Development this project I used the following  technologies and frameworks:

 - Maven;
 - Spring Boot;
 - Java 8;
 - jUnit;
 - Caffeine Cache
 - Hystrix.
